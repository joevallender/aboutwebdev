I needed to test an app on the iOS simulator that used a local API provided by Laravel over Valet. Iâ€™d enabled ssl for the domain with the `valet secure` command but was receiving the following error in the Xcode console.

> File Transfer Error: The certificate for this server is invalid. You might be connecting to a server that is pretending to be which could put your confidential information at risk.

I had a real nightmare Googling a good solution, but finally came across exactly what I was looking from Juan Rangel on StackOverflow.

In the end, all that I needed to do was drag the following file and drop it on the emulator.

> ~/.config/valet/CA/LaravelValetCASelfSigned.pem

The option in the picture below was automatically enabled when I dropped the file. If you want to check, you can find it at Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings (at the very bottom of the About screen).
